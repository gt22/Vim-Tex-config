#Vim tex confings
My configs for writing tex in vim

Course-specific snippets are controlled by CUR_VIM_SNIPS enviroment variable, 'main' snippets are always loaded

#WARNING: This repo is designed to contain all vim config within it. Setup script will delete ~/.vimrc, ~/.vim/UltiSnips directory and local texmf package directory (~/Library/texmf/tex/latex for macOS).
